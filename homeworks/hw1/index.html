    <li>1. I learned that to create a well designed app you have to 
      consider a lot of factors including hierarchy, content, intent,
      audience. These factors will help create an asethetically pleasing 
      and user friendly design.
    </li>
    <li>2. My favorite part of the articel is the breakdown of the differnet
        apps. I found the different observations that the author made to be
         really interesting.

    <li>3. "As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about
        everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made 
        for this product."
      </li>
    <li>4. I would rate the article a 7.
