						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> A useful piece of information that I learned from the article is that it is crucial to 
								identify the purpose of the design early on. The purpose of the design will determine a
								lot of important factors including what information will be conveyed and what mediums or 
								resources will be used to implement the design. Typography is especially important in
								regards to purpose because it will help set the mood and tone. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the font inspiration section. I like how the article
								took the time to provide various resources to browse for inspiration. I'm a visual learner
								so I find it very useful to have different typographies complied together. </p>
