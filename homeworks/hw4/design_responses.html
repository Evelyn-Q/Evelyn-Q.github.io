						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that although color choice is important in designing an accessible website there are other important factors to consider other than just color.
								Relaying crucial system information using only color can make it difficult for people with disabilities to navigate your website. It is important to also
								incorporate other symbols, messaginf, or iconography in order to clearly and easily convey information. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article is how it emphasied the need to be conscious of your design choice to make them accesible to everyone.
							It is always important to be aware of how your design choices can affect and possibly alienate certain groups of people. Also I liked how besides 
							citing the legal reasoning behind accesible design the article pointed out that it is also a nice thing to keep in mind.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.”
								Justin Reyna </p>
