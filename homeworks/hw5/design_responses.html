                            <p> I learned that a lot of websites incorporate movement into their designs. This includes both animations and 
                                moving pictures that add a lot of depth to the designs. I noticed that some animations were automatic and some tied to mouse movement.

                            <p> My favorite part of this article was the design the variety of designs that they showcased. They had a range of aesthetics and styles that were 
                                really unique and presented in different formats. I also enjoyed how they showed both web and mobile designs. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was the design "Dark by 𝔅𝔢𝔰𝔱𝔖𝔢𝔯𝔳𝔢𝔡𝔅𝔬𝔩𝔡". This design really caught my eye because of the animation
                                and perspective change. I really enjoyed how the movement was tied to the cursor and how impactful yet
                                minimalistic the design was. Overall the perspective being inside the cave added to the spooky atmosphere and helped situate the viewer in the setting.</p>
