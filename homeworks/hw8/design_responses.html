				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that despite dark patterns effects and consequences there are currently no easy solutions or alternatives to
							combat it. Some people have suggested that web designers need to have a code of conduct that they abide by that outlines
						    ethical expectatios when desigining. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was how thourgh it was in describing the differnet types of dark patterns. Some of the
							ones's I found the most interesting was the trick question and privacy zuckering. The trick question pattern especailly
						    was suprising considering the fact that it is intentionally misleading users yet there are no regulations around it. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. 
							We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society 
							behave. Giving in to dark patterns for meeting short-term goals is not the solution." </p>
					</li>
